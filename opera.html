     <h3>The Pirates of Penzance</h3>
     <h4>ACT II</h4>
     <p>
        Oh, dry the glist'ning tear
       <br> That dews that martial cheek,<br>
   Thy loving children hear,<br>
        In them thy comfort seek.<br>
   With sympathetic care
        Their<br> arms around thee creep,<br>
   For oh, they cannot bear<br>
        To see their father weep!<br>
     </p>
    <p>
        Go and do your best endeavour,        <br>Such expressions don't
        appear,<br>
        And before all links we sever                    <br>Tarantara,
        tarantara!<br>
        We will say farewell for ever.       <br> Calculated men to cheer,
            <br> Go to glory and the grave!<br>                  Tarantara!<br></p>
        For your foes and fierce and   <br>       Who are going to their fate,<br>
             ruthless,                                   Tarantara,
        tarantara!<br>
        False, unmerciful, and                <br>In a highly nervous stateâ€”
             truthless.    <br>                             <br> Tarantara!
        Young and tender, old and            <br> We observe too great a
        stress,<br>
             toothless,                                  Tarantara,
        tarantara!<br>
        All in vain their mercy crave.        <br>On the risks that on us
        press,<br>
                                                         Tarantara!
                                              And of reference a lack,<br>
                                                         Tarantara,
        tarantara!
                                              <br>To our chance of coming back,
                                                         Tarantara!
        <p>
            With cat-like tread,
            <br>Upon our prey we steal;
       In silence dread,<br>
        Our cautious way we feel.
       No sound at all!<br>
        We never speak a word;
       A fly's foot-fall
            Would be distinctly heard
        </p>
        <p>
        
        </p>
    </p>
        <p>
        We will say farewell for ever.        Calculated men to cheer,<br>
        Go to glory and the grave!    <br>              Tarantara!
       <br> For your foes and fierce and          Who are going to their fate,
        ruthless,     <br>                              Tarantara,
        tarantara!
         A rollicking band of pirates we,
            Who, tired of tossing on the sea,<br>
            Are trying their hand at a burglaree,
            With weapons grim and gory.<br>
            <br>With cat-like tread,
            Upon our prey we steal;
            In silence dread,<br>
            Our cautious way we feel.
        
            
            No sound at all!
            We never speak a word;<br>
            A fly's foot-fall<br>
            Would be distinctly heard
        </p>
        <p>
            We triumph now, for well we           You triumph now, for well we
            trow  <br>                                trow
            Your mortal career's cut short;       <br>Our mortal career's cut
            short;
