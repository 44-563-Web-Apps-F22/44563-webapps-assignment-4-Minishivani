    <h4 class="chorus">CHORUS.</h4>

    <p class="song">
        Oh, dry the glist'ning tear
                 That dews that martial cheek,
            Thy loving children hear,
                 In them thy comfort seek.
            With sympathetic care
                 Their arms around thee creep,
            For oh, they cannot bear
                 To see their father weep!
    </p>
    <h4 class="name gir">GIR:</h4>
    <p class="song gir">Oh, dry the glist'ning tear, etc.
         (FREDERIC enters)</p> 
     <h4 class="name mab">MAB:</h4>  
     <p class="song mab">Oh, Frederic, cannot you, in the calm excellence of
        your wisdom, reconcile it with your conscience to say
        something that will relieve my father's sorrow?</p> 

    <h4 class="name fre">FRE:</h4>  
        <p class="song fre">I will try, dear Mabel.  But why does he sit, night
            after night, in this draughty old ruin?</p> 
     <h4 class="name gen">GEN:</h4> <p class="song gret">Why do I sit here?  To escape from the pirates'
        clutches, I described myself as an orphan; and, heaven
        help me, I am no orphan!  I come here to humble myself
        before the tombs of my ancestors, and to implore their
        pardon for having brought dishonour on the family
        escutcheon.</p>      
        <h4 class="name fre">FRE:</h4> 
        <p class="song fre">But you forget, sir, you only bought the property a
            year ago, and the stucco on your baronial castle is
            scarcely dry.</p>
    <h4 class="name gen">GEN:</h4>  
    <p class="song gen">Frederic, in this chapel are ancestors: you cannot deny
        that.  With the estate, I bought the chapel and its
        contents.  I don't know whose ancestors they were, but
        I know whose ancestors they are, and I shudder to think
        that their descendant by purchase (if I may so describe
        myself) should have brought disgrace upon what, I have
        no doubt, was an unstained escutcheon.</p>
    <h4 class="name fre">FRE:</h4>  
        <p class="song fre">Be comforted.  Had you not acted as you did, these
            reckless men would assuredly have called in the nearest
            clergyman, and have married your large family on the
            spot.</p> 
    <h4 class="name gen">GEN:</h4>  
            <p class="song gen">I thank you for your proffered solace, but it is
                unavailing.  I assure you, Frederic, that such is the
                anguish and remorse I feel at the abominable falsehood
                by which I escaped these easily deluded pirates, that I
                would go to their simple-minded chief this very night
                and confess all, did I not fear that the consequences
                would be most disastrous to myself.  At what time does
                your expedition march against these scoundrels?</p>  
    <h4 class="name fre">FRE:</h4>  
                <p class="song fre">At eleven, and before midnight I hope to have atoned
                    for my involuntary association with the pestilent
                    scourges by sweeping them from the face of the earthâ€”
                    and then, dear Mabel, you will be mine!</p> 
    <h4 class="name gen">GEN:</h4>  
                    <p class="song gen">Are your devoted followers at hand?
                        hey are, they only wait my orders.</p>

    <p class="direction">(Enter POLICE, marching in single file. They form in line, facing
        audience.)</p>
